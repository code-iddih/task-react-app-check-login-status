!! ================== SIMPLE REACT APP WITH CONDITIONAL RENDERING ================== !!

This project is a basic React application that demonstrates conditional rendering based on user login status. It includes a login/logout functionality and displays different content based on whether the user is logged in or not. The Button also changes the colour depending on the User's Login Status.

Enjoy!!
